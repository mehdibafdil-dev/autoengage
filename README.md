# Autoengage - A Versatile User Engagement Automation Tool

Autoengage is a Python script that simulates human-like browsing behavior on websites. It uses the Selenium WebDriver to connect to a target website and perform various actions to mimic the behavior of a real user.

## Features

- Supports multiple countries, cities, referrers, and user agents to create diverse visitor profiles
- Simulates realistic browsing behavior, including scrolling, mouse movements, and random clicks
- Handles proxy usage to rotate IP addresses and improve anonymity
- Provides detailed connection statistics, including total, successful, and failed attempts
- Supports running multiple connection attempts to the same URL

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   - `selenium`
   - `requests`

2. Download the appropriate ChromeDriver executable for your system and update the `Service` path in the `init_driver()` method.

3. Customize the configuration settings in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` section:
   - `country`: The country code for the target location (e.g., "pl" for Poland)
   - `cities`: A list of cities associated with the target country
   - `referrers`: A list of referrer URLs to use
   - `user_agents`: A list of user agent strings to use
   - `timezone`: The timezone for the target location
   - `proxies`: A list of proxy server addresses (optional)
   - `use_proxy`: A boolean flag to enable or disable proxy usage

4. Run the script:
   ```
   python autoengage.py
   ```

5. The script will start visiting the specified URL (`url_to_visit`) the number of times defined by `number_of_attempts`. It will print out connection statistics and a summary at the end.

## Limitations and Considerations

- The script is designed for educational and research purposes only. Please use it responsibly and respect the terms of service of the websites you visit.
- The script does not handle JavaScript-heavy websites or pages that require user interaction beyond basic browsing.
- The script does not handle captchas or other anti-bot measures that may be implemented by websites.
- The use of proxies may be subject to legal and ethical considerations, depending on your location and the websites you're visiting.
